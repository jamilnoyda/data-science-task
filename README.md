Problems:
Solutions:
Charts for 1st problem(cancelation ride in each day):
Charts for 1st problem(cancelation ride in each city):
Charts for 1st problem( cancelation ride in each month):
Charts for 2nd problem(total number of a ride in each city id, per day and month):
ride booking with web vs mobile
Tools:



Problems:
fixing to cancelation ride
increase the rate of their cabs based area, time of day, etc
Applying geo-surge strategy(finding most booking)
Solutions:
We build an admin panel showing possibly all charts, useful information and reports, and data science would have access to the admin panel. Like zomato is doing for themselves. And let their data science take a decision or maybe we can suggest plans and strategy by analyzing the admin panel. So how to decide which feature they need!  We can build admin features according to what they want to fix problems and that’s what I'm going to do!

Charts for 2nd problem(total number of a ride in each city id, per day and month):
Finding the city’s most get traffic of booking and we can do for a month and day and then can apply a srug charge for an only particular city on which day.


Same thing we can do for each day and each month to figuring out increase the rate of their cabs

Same thing we can do for successfully rides for each city id, each day and each month
This will helps them to fix Applying geo-surge strategy and increase the rate of their cabs based area, time of day, etc. i hope you will understand what here I'm trying to explain.
Also, this will helps them to Identify what areas and at what times get most bookings and how would they increase the price in those areas in order to meet the demand.







ride booking with web vs mobile
I'm comparing ride booking with web vs mobile
So that we can focus on which platform we should follow

 
Tools:
Tools that i have used is matplotlib for that creating chart and Jupiter notebook for coding, equations, visualizations.
